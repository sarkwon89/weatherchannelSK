##Technologies
This web application was built using html, CSS and Jquery.  This application is pulling data using AJAX calls from 3 APIs (https://openweathermap.org/api): 1)Current weather data, 2) UV index 3) 5 Day forecast.  Used Bootstrap to create the layout and used moment.JS to get current date.
